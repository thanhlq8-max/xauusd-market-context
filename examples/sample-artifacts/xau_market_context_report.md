- Headline: External XAU context has passed the initial data-readiness gate.
- Now: The system can provide bounded monitor context from validated external sources.

## What This Artifact Cannot Claim

- It cannot infer centralized spot-gold orderflow from broker CSV files.
- It cannot infer actual dealer inventory or actual retail-side positioning.
- It cannot provide execution instructions or profitability claims.
- It cannot treat broker tick activity as centralized traded volume.

## Limitations

- Monitor-only context summary; not an execution plan.
- Broker tick activity remains a local activity proxy, not centralized volume.
- Session levels are references from supplied CSV data only.
- Practical zone deck ranks supplied session references by distance only; it does not infer direction.

## Warnings

- USD_HIGH_IMPACT_EVENT_PRESENT

## Errors

- No schema or source errors were emitted.
